
Shame to him who would hint that the reader's interest shall altogether pursue
the Margrave August Michael von Paulsen Quigg. I am indeed astray if my hand
fail in keeping the way where my peruser's heart would follow. Then let us, on
the morrow, peep quickly in at the door of Hildebrant, harness maker.

Hildebrant's 200 pounds reposed on a bench, silver-buckling a raw leather
martingale.

Bill Watson came in first.

"Vell," said Hildebrant, shaking all over with the vile conceit of the joke-
maker, "haf you guessed him? 'Vat kind of a hen lays der longest?'"

"Er--why, I think so," said Bill, rubbing a servile chin. "I think so, Mr.
Hildebrant--the one that lives the longest-- Is that right?"

"Nein!" said Hildebrant, shaking his head violently. "You haf not guessed der
answer."

Bill passed on and donned a bed-tick apron and bachelorhood.

In came the young man of the Arabian Night's fiasco--pale, melancholy,
hopeless.

"Vell," said Hildebrant, "haf you guessed him? 'Vat kind of a hen lays der
longest?'"

Simmons regarded him with dull savagery in his eye. Should he curse this
mountain of pernicious humor--curse him and die? Why should-- But there was
Laura.

Dogged, speechless, he thrust his hands into his coat pockets and stood. His
hand encountered the strange touch of the Margrave's card. He drew it out and
looked at it, as men about to be hanged look at a crawling fly. There was
written on it in Quigg's bold, round hand: "Good for one roast chicken to
bearer."

Simmons looked up with a flashing eye.

"A dead one!" said he.

"Goot!" roared Hildebrant, rocking the table with giant glee. "Dot is right!
You gome at mine house at 8 o'clock to der party."
